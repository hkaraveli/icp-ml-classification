# ICP Machine Learning Classification Using Gene Expression

This repository demonstrates the classification of intracranial pressure (ICP) status using machine learning algorithms and qPCR-based gene expression data.  
The project utilizes open-access data from the **NASA GeneLab OSD-364** study:  
*Inflammatory gene expression signatures in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: possible implications in microgravity-induced ICP elevation â€“ Plasma* ([DOI:10.1038/s41526-017-0036-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-017-0036-6)).

## Background

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a critical health risk for astronauts during long-duration space missions. This project applies machine learning techniques to identify clinical and gene expression markers of ICP elevation, using real patient data from NASA's open-access OSD-364 study.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source**: NASA GeneLab (OSD-364), [Ames Research Center](https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/13553)
- **Objective**: Classify ICP status (high/normal) and identify potential biomarker genes for ICP elevation, with implications for both neuroscience and space medicine.
- **Methods**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering (age, weight, height, BMI)
  - Supervised classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN)
  - Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC)
  - Model explainability (SHAP analysis)
  - Differential gene expression analysis (Mann-Whitney U test)
  - Dimensionality reduction (PCA) and clustering (K-Means)
